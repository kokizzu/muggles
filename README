Quickstart (for typical 2-uplinks, serving 1 LAN case)
The setup

Assuming you have 3 ethernet cards on your gateway box.

    * eth0 faces your lan, and is 192.168.0.12 by default.
    * eth1 is your uplink1, and is 192.168.11.12 by default.
    * eth2 is your uplink2, and is 192.168.12.12 by default. 

also:

    * alan is one machine on the lan by default
    * blan is another machine on the lan by default 

In pictures:

The install

The 8-fold path to a higher uplink state...

1. Install lenny with a minimal bunch of packages (no x needed).

    * With the debian-503-i386-netinst.iso, when it detects the network interfaces chose any one as the primary, but keep the interfaces physically disconnected. Let it try to dhcp and fail, then choose "do not configure network at this time". Kind of silly, but keeps it simple. 

    * When it prompts you for package selection near the end of the installation, you can drop the selection "standard" so that it is truly a minimal installation. 

2. aptitude install incron iproute dnsmasq lighttpd sudo nmap logrotate vnstat squid resolvconf openntpd ntpdate mtr-tiny dnsutils

    * If you don't have them already, you will probably want to aptitude install openssh-client openssh-server. They are useful extras, but not necessary. Go on, just install them too. 

3. Unpack the tgz file in, say /root/muggles_source.

4. To install, run ./installscript.

5. Set the static ip addresses in /etc/network/interfaces to the static ips you are to use for the lan and uplinks.

6. Change/add mac addresses of the lan machines to /etc/dnsmasq.conf (the dhcp-host= entries. Replace alan, blan etc.)

7. Connect up alan (or rather, its replacement). You already entered the mac address for this machine in the previous step. If you have a normal modern OS, then the machine will simply auto-configure and get its network; dns and time settings from the muggles box. Then point your browser to http://192.168.0.12 (or whatever you've changed it to in step 5)

8. admire the pre-millennial web interface

You should have now have a basic muggles with web gui front end. It does web and dns caching; time serving; checks for lenny updates; informs you of monthly use per uplink; lets you know what machines are alive on the lan; and checks and lets you change your uplinks from the web gui.

If you're unlucky or your setup is less simple, well, here are the details so you can fix things to taste:

The Details
===========


Detailed documentation at:


http://code.google.com/p/muggles/wiki/PageName#Not-so-Quickstart_(for_if_you_want_more)





some loose ends, notes which will be migrated to the wiki url above:

logrotate
for if the /var/log/muggles files keep growing and you want to keep them. Or you can just cron remove them.

vbox
Test environment setup:

vboxmanage clonevdi alanclient.vdi dlanclient.vdi   (make sure alanclient.vdi is powered off)
vboxmanage registerimage disk dlanclient.vdi
vboxmanage createvm -name dlanclient

do a comparison between vboxmanage showvminfo dlanclient and vboxmanage showvminfo alanclient, and modify acordingly,
eg: vboxmanage modifyvm dlanclient -ostype Debian -memory 512MB
